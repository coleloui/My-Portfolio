# My-Portfolio

## This was a fun assignment. I think the biggest issue was getting the text to wrap around the image on index.html and the reason was because of setting the img to a media and not allowing the float-left to operate properly.

I used Bootstrap for the design and most of the elements of the work. https://getbootstrap.com/ The first 3 portfolio cards are projects that I have created or have been a part of. If you click on one of the images you will be taken to the website, and if you click on the title you will be taken to the repository on GitHub.

I googled the Images for the portfolio of League of Legends, and Dota 2. I would like to thank **Andrew Crisp** for his overall help, as well as Morgan Conlin for her assistance with the color scheme.
