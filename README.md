# My-Portfolio


## 
This was a fun assignment. I think the biggest issue was getting the text to wrap around the image on index.html and the reason was because of setting the img to a media and not allowing the float-left to operate properly.

## 
I used Bootstrap for the design and most of the elements of the work. https://getbootstrap.com/
I googled the Images for the portfolio of Timthetatman, Dr.Lupo, World of Warcraft, League of Legends, and Dota 2.

I would like to thank Andrew Crisp for his overall help, as well as Morgan Conlin for her assistance with the color scheme.
