                        <p class="ml-3">Hi, I'm Louis Coleman, born and raised in Tampa, Fl and lived there until
                            October of
                            2019 when I moved to Seattle, WA.</p>
                        <p class="ml-3 mr-2">Growing up I always had a huge facination in computers, mainly gaming. This
                            continued as I grew older and at times had an impact on school. I attended Idaho State
                            University for Civil Engineering, where I left after a few months into my second year. When
                            I returned home I began to research different programming languages. At the time I was
                            working at RinkSide Sports, a pro shop in the Brandon Ice Sports Forum, where I had mainly
                            played growing up, and the recently opened AdventHealth Center Ice. I then transitioned to
                            my
                            familys construction company Pelican Building Contracting where I worked my way up over the
                            years from being a Laborer, Forklift Operator, and eventually the Office Manager and
                            Bookeeper. I was also playing Rugby for the Bay Area Pelicans based out of St.Pete, I was
                            also the President for a couple of years. This
                            took up a lot of my time and though I took some classes in community college I was never
                            fully able to push myself to take the classes and fulfill my desire to pick up coding. When
                            I moved to Seattle, with the help of my Girlfriend, Shannon, I was able to find the coding
                            bootcamp and decided that this was my opportunity to go for working in an industry which I
                            had a huge passion in! I owe a huge thanks to my family, Shannon, and her family for helping
                            me along
                            the way to get in the position where I am and can't wait for what comes next!</p>
